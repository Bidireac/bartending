## General info
The page loads with only 3 random beverages. If you scroll down, it will load more, and more, 
until it runs out of cocktails recipes or the user gets bored of scrolling and stops for a drink.
You can search for a specific cocktail, or you can try a broader approach, and search for an ingredient  
and the page will enlist all the cocktails that contain that specific ingredient.
